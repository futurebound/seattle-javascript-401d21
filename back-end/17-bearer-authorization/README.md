# Lab 17 ~ Bearer Authorization

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This lab is focused on utilizing basic authorization and hashing to create account creation and login routes for an application. We need to create our own custom basic-auth middleware, and an authorization user module.

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.
