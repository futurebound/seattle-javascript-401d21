===

## Daily Plan
- Notes:
    - Anything top of mind?
    - Data Structures Repos _at some point..._

- Code Review _Implement FS Storage?_
- Stacks & Queues
- Lab Preview


## Learning Objectives
* Students will be able to implement a doubly linked list
* Students will be able to implement a stack
* Students will be able to identify use cases for a stack
* Students will be able to implement a queue
* Students will be able to identify use cases for a queue
* Students will understand the inner workings or Binary Search

## Resources
* Watch [stacks and queues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjI1WNcIntg)
* Skim [stack wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))
* Skim [queue wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))

#### Stacks
Stacks are a data structure that serve as a collection of elements. These elements are stacked in a last in, first out sequence **(aka FILO - first in, last out)**. It may help to think about a stack as a collection of plates and the way that you add and remove them.

Common methods include:
  * `pop` removes the most recent element from the stack
  * `push` adds a new element to the stack

#### Queues
Queues are also a data structure that serve as a collection of elements. Elements in a queue are added in a first in, first out sequence **(aka FIFO - first in first out)**. It may help to think about a queue as a bunch of people standing in line at a concert - the first person in line is the first person in the venue.

Common methods include:
  * `enqueue` is used to add an element to the end of a queue
  * `dequeue` is used to retrieve and remove an element from the beginning of a queue
